# OpenChat

https://oc.app

OpenChat is a fully featured chat application running end-to-end on the Internet Computer blockchain.

## Prerequisites

#### DFX 0.14.3

To install, run `DFX_VERSION=0.14.3 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"`

#### Rust

To install, run `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

#### NPM

Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download

## Testing locally

Start DFX using `dfx start`

To install all the necessary canisters (OpenChat and NNS) run `./scripts/deploy-local.sh`

To run the website run `npm --prefix frontend run dev`

To upgrade a canister run `./scripts/upgrade-canister-local.sh <DFX_IDENTITY_NAME> <CANISTER_NAME> <VERSION>` (eg. `./scripts/upgrade-canister-local.sh default user 1.0.0`)

To start again with a fresh install, stop DFX, then run `rm -rf .dfx`, then start from the top of these instructions again.

## Deterministic builds

We need builds to be deterministic so that code running inside a canister can be verified by comparing the
wasm hash locally with the wasm hash exposed by the IC.

You can build the OpenChat canister wasms by running `./scripts/docker-build.sh`
