                    Before you can use our Services, you need to set up an account and provide
                    certain information. You can do this via our Platform.

                <li>
                    To set up an account, our Platform will ask you to authenticate your identity
                    via a third party identity provider. By authenticating your identity, you agree
                    to the terms of the third party identity provider.

                    As part of setting up your account, you may be provided with or asked to create
                    security details. You must keep your security details secure and not disclose
                    them to anyone else. Any action or instruction by anyone using your security
                    details will be treated as if such action or instruction had been made by you,
                    and we are not responsible for any loss as a result. You should contact us
                    immediately upon discovering any unauthorised use of your security details.

                            you have on the OpenChat Platform, the OpenChat Platform may not prompt
                            the next user of the device used to access the OpenChat Platform to
                            enter credentials in order to use the OpenChat Platform. If you do not
                            log out of the OpenChat Platform at the end of each session, there is a
                            risk that another person may impersonate you to access your Cryptoassets
                            without your knowledge or consent, and the OpenChat Platform may treat
                            them as if they are the owner of those Cryptoassets. We are not
                            responsible for any losses as a consequence of your failure to log out

                    Platform to make a Swap.

                <li>

                            an Exchange Swap, which is where the OpenChat Platform offers you a
                            price for the Cryptoasset, and the transaction is completed using the
                            third party exchange(s) the OpenChat Platform is linked to; or

                        <li>
                            a P2P Swap, which is where you send a message to the users of a chat
                            with the proposed terms of a transaction, and the OpenChat Platform
                            facilitates you in completing that transaction with the other user.

                <li>
                    In order to make an Exchange Swap, you need to choose (i) your Source
                    Cryptoasset, (ii) your Target Cryptoasset and (ii) the amount of the Source
                    Cryptoasset you wish to exchange for that Target Cryptoasset. You can then ask
                    us to provide you with a proposed estimated exchange rate. This exchange rate
                    reflects the rate(s) provided by the third party exchange(s) we are connected
                    with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you instruct us to proceed with an Exchange Swap, we will transfer the Source
                    Cryptoasset from your OpenChat Wallet to the relevant third party exchange to
                    make the conversion. You will then receive the Target Cryptoasset back to your
                    OpenChat Wallet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where we use a third party exchange to complete an Exchange Swap, please note
                    that the exchange rates provided by us are an estimated rate at the time you
                    request the rate. The actual rate provided will be determined at the time you
                    instruct us to make the Exchange Swap. <strong>
                        As the prices of Cryptoassets can be highly volatile, we do not guarantee
                        that the amount of Target Cryptoassets you acquire from an Exchange Swap
                        will be the same as that set out in the proposed exchange rate. Rather, it
                        will reflect the rate actually obtained when the Exchange Swap is actually
                        executed by the third party exchange (which may result you in receiving less
                        of the Target Cryptoasset than that predicted by the estimated exchange rate
                        you receive

                The value of the Cryptoassets can fall as well as rise. If you buy Cryptoassets, you
                may not get back the full amount you spent on them, or anything at all. The value of
                Cryptoassets may depend on fluctuations in the financial markets, or other economic
                factors, which are outside our control. The past performance of a Cryptoassets is

                Fluctuations in the price of Cryptoassets are subject to significant price
                volatility. The prices of Cryptoassets have historically been subject to dramatic
                fluctuations and are highly volatile. A range of factors may influence the market
                price, if any, of Cryptoassets , including, but not limited to: (i) the ability (if
                any) of Cryptoassets to trade on a secondary market; (ii) global supply and demand
                (iii) general expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates and
                exchange rates; (iv) changes in the software, software requirements or hardware
                requirements underlying Cryptoassets; (v) changes in the rights, obligations,
                incentives, or rewards for holders of Cryptoassets;(vii) interruptions in service
                from or failures of exchanges on which Cryptoassets are traded; (viii) investment
                and trading activities of large purchasers, including private and registered funds,
                that may directly or indirectly invest in Cryptoassets; (ix) monetary policies of
                governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; (x)
                regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of Cryptoassets and changes in
                Applicable Law; (xi) global or regional political, economic or financial events and
                situations; and (x) expectations among participants that the value of a particular
                Cryptoasset or Cryptoassets generally will soon change. A decrease in the price of a
                single cryptoasset may cause volatility in the entire cryptoasset industry and may
                affect the Cryptoassets available via our Services. Volatility in the price of
                Cryptoassets may result in significant loss over a short period of time.

            <h3>
                Risk of losing access to Cryptoassets due to loss of private key(s) and wallet(s)
            </h3>
            <p>
                A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to deal in
                Cryptoassets. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your
                digital wallet or vault storing Cryptoassets will result in loss of such
                Cryptoassets. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s),
                including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use
                (including the OpenChat Wallet), may be able to misappropriate your Cryptoassets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the wallet you use to
                receive and store Cryptoassets, including your own failure to properly maintain or
                use such wallet, may also result in the loss of your Cryptoassets. Failure to
                precisely follow any procedures set forth by us for dealing in Cryptoassets,
                including, for instance, providing an incorrect wallet address, or using
                incompatible wallet(s), may result in the loss of Cryptoassets you hold.

            <h3>Regulatory risks</h3>
            <p>
                Regulation of Cryptoassets and the offering thereof, as well as blockchain
                technologies, and cryptoasset exchanges is currently underdeveloped and likely to
                rapidly evolve. Regulation varies significantly between different jurisdictions and
                is subject to significant uncertainty. Regulators may in the future adopt laws,
                regulations, guidance or other actions that may severely impact the development,
                operations and growth of the OpenChat Platform and the adoption and utility of
                Cryptoassets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Risks associated with the blockchain protocol</h3>
            <p>
                Because Cryptoassets are based on blockchain protocols, any malfunction, breakdown
                or abandonment of a blockchain protocol may have a material adverse effect on
                Cryptoassets. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the
                development of quantum computing, could present risks to Cryptoassets by rendering
                ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain
                protocol.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Risk of hacking and software and security weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
                Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with
                Cryptoassets in a variety of ways, including malware attacks, denial of service
                attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, as well as
                attacks which overpower the consensus-based mechanism on which the blockchain in
                built and attacks which interfere with or otherwise cause nodes to malfunction
                (nodes are computers / hardware devices that help maintain the blockchain).
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and
                theories we use could contain Viruses or Vulnerabilities. Viruses or Vulnerabilities
                could cause, inter alia, complete loss of Cryptoassets, or could negatively affect
                the OpenChat Platform.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Other potential risks applicable to Cryptoassets</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to the risks included in this Schedule 1, there are other risks
                associated with dealing in Cryptoassets (including CHAT), including those that we
                cannot reasonably foresee. Additional risks may also materialize as unanticipated
                variations or combinations of the risks discussed above in this Schedule 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where you deal in any Cryptoasset you should take care to understand the risks
                involved. In this respect, we note some of the additional specific risks relevant to
                CHAT. In relation to Cryptoassets other than CHAT, it is usual for the issuer of the
                Cryptoasset to provide an explanation of the risks involved (or if they have not,
                this can be an indicator that a Cryptoasset is particularly risky as there has been
                a lack of consideration of the risks relevant to that Cryptoasset). By dealing in
                any Cryptoasset, you confirm to us that you have taken to time to understand, and
                accept, the risks involved (including in respect of the risks as explained by the
                issuer of the Cryptoasset).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Forks and Airdrops</h3>
            <p>
                The underlying protocols of Cryptoassets may be subject to substantial changes in
                their operating rules (called a “forks”), and these may alter the value or function
                of a Cryptoasset. A fork may result in multiple versions of a Cryptoasset, leading
                to volatility as one version becomes dominant over another, which may lose its
                value.
            </p>
            <p>
                There may be additional distributions (called an “airdrop”) made to holders of a
                particular Cryptoasset, which may be a new variant of a Cryptoasset or a further
                quantity of the same Cryptoasset. The (anticipated) occurrence of an airdrop may
                impact the value of the Cryptoasset(s) affected by that airdrop.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>CHAT specific risks</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As noted elsewhere in these Terms, CHAT is not being structured or sold as securities nor
        any other form of regulated investment product. Accordingly, there has not been any
        consideration as to whether the CHAT is a suitable or an appropriate thing for you to deal
        in. In addition to the General Cryptoasset risks, you should be aware of the following risks
        in relation to CHAT specifically:
    </p>
    <ul class="custom_list" style={"--prefix: ''"}>
        <li>
            <h3>Lack of operating history</h3>
            <p>
                Purchases of CHAT involve a high degree of risk. The value of CHAT is reliant on the
                success of us developing our business. As such, CHAT has all of the risks and
                uncertainties normally associated with a developing business, including in respect
                of potential difficulties operating the OpenChat Platform, lack of name recognition,
                lack of adequate capital to progress the business, and difficulties in complying
                with all Applicable Law. Financial and operational risks confronting start-ups are
                significant and we are not immune to these. The market in which we compete is highly
                competitive, and the percentage of companies that survive and prosper is small.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our lack of an operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our
                business and long-term operating prospects and the prospects of the OpenChat
                Platform in connection with acquiring CHAT. These risks include, but are not limited
                to, our ability to: (i) increase revenues and manage costs relating to the operation
                of the OpenChat Platform; (ii) increase awareness of the OpenChat Platform and CHAT;
                (iii) offer compelling content on the OpenChat Platform; (iv) maintain current and
                develop new strategic relationships; (v) respond effectively to competitive
                pressures; (vi) continue to develop and upgrade technology; and (vii) raise any
                additional capital as potentially required. There are no assurances that our
                business strategy will be successful, nor that we will address these risks
                successfully during the operation of the OpenChat Platform and CHAT.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Risks associated with uncertain regulation</h3>
            <p>
                The regulatory status of the CHAT may be unclear or unsettled in certain
                jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may
                apply existing regulation with respect to CHAT and its applications, including the
                OpenChat Platform. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures
                or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting
                distributed ledger technology and its applications. Regulatory actions could
                negatively impact CHAT in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration
                only, through a determination that CHAT are a regulated financial instrument that
                require registration or licensing. We may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the
                event that regulatory actions, or changes to Applicable Law, make it illegal to
                operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary
                regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                More generally, the OpenChat Platform is pioneered on new and evolving technology,
                which increases legal complexity, particularly as the Applicable Law is subject to
                interpretation and change. This could result in a variety of adverse consequences,
                including civil penalties and fines as well as the requirement that some or all of
                our Services by restricted or prohibited in certain jurisdictions. These
                developments could have an adverse effect on the operations of the OpenChat Platform
                and the value of CHAT.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Legal proceedings and litigation</h3>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or litigation. The
                results of such legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and,
                regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our
                business, because of defence and settlement costs, diversion of resources, and other
                factors. Generally, if third parties are successful in their claims, we may have to
                pay substantial damages, account for profits derived from the alleged infringing
                acts, and cease to use certain technologies or take other actions that could be
                detrimental to our business. If there is an intellectual property infringement
                claim, or to avoid such claims, we may be prohibited from selling or licensing to
                others some or all Services we develop, unless the patent or copyright holder grants
                a license of the relevant intellectual property to us, which the patent or copyright
                holder is not obligated to do. There also may be adverse publicity associated with
                litigation that could negatively affect people’s perception of us, the OpenChat
                Platform and/or CHAT, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we are
                ultimately found liable. Accordingly, litigation may adversely affect our business
                and financial condition.

            <h3>Intellectual property</h3>
            <p>
                Companies, organisations, or individuals, including competitors, may hold or obtain
                patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or
                interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell, and / or market CHAT and /
                or the OpenChat Platform, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our
                business. These third parties may have applied for, been granted, or obtained,
                patents that relate to intellectual property, and which compete with our
                intellectual property or technology. This may require us to develop or obtain
                alternative technology, or obtain appropriate licenses under these patents, which
                may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Such a circumstance may result
                in us having to significantly increase development efforts and resources to redesign
                the technology in order for us to safeguard our competitive edge against competitors
                in the same industry. There is a risk that our means of protecting intellectual
                property rights may not be adequate, and weaknesses or failures in this area could
                adversely affect our business or reputation, financial condition, the operations of
                the OpenChat Platform and the development of CHAT.
            </p>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may receive communications from holders of patents or
                trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other
                intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or
                otherwise assert their rights and urge us to take licenses. In addition, if we are
                determined to have infringed upon a third party's intellectual property rights, we
                may be required to cease operating the OpenChat Platform or certain Services, pay
                substantial damages, seek a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual
                property right (which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all),
                and/or establish and maintain alternative branding for items relating to the
                OpenChat Platform and our Services. We may need to file lawsuits to protect our
                intellectual property rights from infringement from third parties, which could be
                expensive, time consuming, and distract management's attention from our core
                operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our ability to serve our customers and the OpenChat Platform’s participants will
                depend upon our intellectual property. The steps we take to protect our intellectual
                property rights may be inadequate. In order to protect our intellectual property
                rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect
                these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property
                rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could
                result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.
                Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with
                defences, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability
                of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our
                intellectual property rights could seriously harm the CHAT brand and adversely
                affect the development of the CHAT.

                After issuance, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law you will have no right to
                return your CHAT to us or to receive a refund or otherwise require us to exchange
                CHAT for a certain value. As a result, if there is not sufficient demand or interest
                in the OpenChat Platform and CHAT, or if there are limits on the transferability of,
                or limited liquidity for, CHAT, then you may lose all or a portion of your

                The distribution by us of a substantial number of CHAT or additional types of token
                could have an adverse effect on the value of CHAT. Any distribution of CHAT could
                dilute your percentage interest in then-outstanding CHAT, if any, and have an
                adverse effect on the market value of the CHAT. Additional new types of cryptoasset
                may also impact the value of CHAT, and you have no rights in relation to such new
                types of cryptoasset as a result of entering into these Terms.

                We intend to use the amounts received from CHAT holders to fund the development of
                our business and the OpenChat Platform. Amounts received from CHAT holders may be
                converted into other cryptoassets or fiat currencies. If the value of cryptoassets
                or fiat currencies fluctuate unfavourably this may mean that we may not be able to
                fund business development and deployment as expected or may not be able to develop
                the OpenChat Platform in the manner it intended, which may consequently impact the
                value of CHAT.

                You may not be able to obtain all information you want from time to time regarding
                the OpenChat Platform and / or CHAT. Even if you do receive such information, you
                may not receive it on a timely basis. It is possible that you may not be aware of
                materially adverse changes that have occurred with respect to the OpenChat Platform
                and/or CHAT in a timely manner. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other
                uncertainties, you may not have accurate or accessible information relating to your
                purchase, which could prevent you from taking actions with the potential to prevent
                adverse consequences relating to your holding of CHAT.

            <h3>CHAT may not be classified as unregulated</h3>
            <p>
                Although we intend for CHAT to be classified as unregulated, the regulatory position
                of cryptoassets can be uncertain and subject to change. This may, at a later date,
                cause us to reclassify CHAT as a security, in which case CHAT may be subject to
                restrictions on resale and transfer.

                Whilst CHAT allows CHAT holders to participate in the governance of the OpenChat DAO
                by voting on proposals, each CHAT holder’s voting power is proportional to the
                amount of CHAT they have deposited and locked. As such, there is a risk that a small
                number of CHAT holders may be able to exercise the majority of the voting power from
                time to time, meaning that other holders of CHAT cannot effectively influence the
                governance of the OpenChat DAO, and devaluing the CHAT they hold.

            share content that glorifies, promotes, or normalises suicide or other acts of physical
            self-harm. This includes content that encourages others to cut, burn, or starve
            themselves, as well as content that normalizes eating disorders, such as anorexia and
            bulimia. Self-harm acts or threats used as a form of emotional manipulation or coercion
            are also prohibited.

        <li>
            promote, coordinate, or execute financial scams. Promoting a particular crypto token or
