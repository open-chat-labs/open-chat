        Setting a new benchmark of environmental responsibility in the tech industry. OpenChat
        becomes the first DAO to integrate IC Footprint 2.0 — a sustainability protocol that
        harnesses the power of ICP smart contracts. This real-time system tracks and records key
        environmental metrics like electricity consumption and carbon emissions directly onto an
        immutable on-chain ledger. Raising consumer awareness about climate issues and increasingly
        stringent environmental regulations are fuelling a growing demand for eco-conscious
        technology especially in crypto.

        Moreover, OpenChat commits to actively decarbonising by acquiring renewable energy
        certificates and carbon credits. Future developments include embedding OpenChat’s
        zero-emissions commitment into a custom ESG smart contract, ensuring automatic compliance
        with its sustainability goals. This innovation underscores OpenChat’s role as a pioneer in
        Web3 and clean crypto.

        OpenChat's dedication to sustainability strengthens its competitive edge. By focusing on
        eco-friendly practices, OpenChat attracts more eco-conscious users and stands out from its
        Web2 competitors like Discord, WhatsApp, and Slack.
    </p>

    <p>
        As OpenChat advances its sustainable practices, it serves as a model for other digital
        platforms, showing that technological innovation and environmental responsibility can
        coexist.
