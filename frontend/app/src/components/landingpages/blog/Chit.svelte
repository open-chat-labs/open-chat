    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        CHIT is a points based reward system, designed to encourage user activity and growth. Users
        will be able to turn their CHIT into CHAT by enrolling in monthly airdrops.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you get it?</h2>
    <p>
        You can claim CHIT once each day when you visit <a href="/">OpenChat</a>. Claiming CHIT on
        consecutive days is called a streak and you earn more daily CHIT once you reach a 3 day
        streak. Your daily CHIT reward increases again at 7 days, 14 days and 30 days.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/blog/chit/claim_streak.png" alt="Claim daily CHIT" />
    <p>
        You can also earn CHIT for various <em>achievements</em> such as sending your first message or
        uploading an avatar image. Also called "learn to earn", this encourages users to explore the
        features of OpenChat. At the time of writing there are 13 possible achievements but this will
        continue to increase over time until all aspects of OpenChat are covered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some users have earned extra CHIT for winning a meme competition and we expect ad hoc CHIT
        rewards like this to continue.
    </p>

    <h2>Badges, leaderboard and calendar</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to CHIT, users gain a profile badge if they are on a 3-day, 7-day, 14-day or
        30-day streak. If a user breaks their streak they will lose their badge and have to start
        again.
    </p>
    <p>
        CHIT balances are displayed on user profiles and there is a leaderboard of users with the
        highest CHIT balances.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/blog/chit/chit_leaderboard.png" alt="CHIT leaderboard" />
    <p>
        On your own profile you can find a calendar with a record of all the CHIT you have earned
        and when. The "learn to earn" popup shows the list of achievements and your progress.

    <h2>CHIT for CHAT</h2>
    <p>
        We plan to hold a CHIT for CHAT airdrop at the end of July with 100,000 CHAT split between
        entrants based on their level of CHIT.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>How to enter the airdrops?</h2>
    <p>
        To enter the airdrop you must join a community called <a
            href="https://oc.app/community/txydz-jyaaa-aaaaf-bifea-cai">CHIT for CHAT</a>
        which requires either <em>lifetime diamond membership</em> or (coming very soon) a
        <em>proof of unique personhood credential</em>
        from <ExternalLink href="https://decideai.xyz/">Decide AI</ExternalLink>. Within the
        community is a channel for the upcoming airdrop which requires standard diamond membership
        to join. The consequence of this double layer of gates is that to enter the airdrop you will
        need either lifetime diamond membership, or proof of unique personhood and standard diamond
        membership.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason for these gates is to discourage mercenary users from farming tokens by creating
        multiple accounts. Some users are uncomfortable about proving they are a unique person
        because they feel it is an invasion of privacy. This is why there is the option to enter the
        airdrop by having lifetime diamond membership. It is unlikely a single person will try to
        farm CHAT by buying multiple lifetime diamond memberships because they are quite expensive.
        However, for future airdrops, if this does seem to be happening, we might remove this
        option.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are confident these measures will be sufficient but the development team also reserves
        the right to exclude users from this community if we determine they are deliberately trying
        to farm tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note, the proof of unique personhood gate is not yet available but it will be in time for
        the first airdrop so it is not necessary to buy lifetime membership. If necessary we will
        postpone the airdrop until this gate is ready.

    <h2>How much CHAT do I get for my CHIT?</h2>
    <p>
        This is a little complicated but we think offers a good balance of fairness and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>The 100,000 CHAT will be split into 2 pots of 80,000 CHAT and 20,000 CHAT.</p>
    <p>
        For every 5,000 CHIT you have earned you will receive 1 share of the first pot of 80,000
        CHAT.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have earned 36,500 CHIT then you will receive 7 shares. Say there are
        10,000 shares altogether you would receive (80,000 x 7 / 10,000) = 56 CHAT. Bear in mind
        that the total amount of CHAT in each airdrop is fixed so the more users that enter the
        lower the amount of CHAT per user.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, for every 25,000 CHIT you have earned you will receive 1 ticket in a lottery
        for the 20,000 CHAT pot. 3 tickets will be drawn randomly and the holders will receive
        12,000, 5,000 and 3,000 CHAT respectively.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Future airdrops</h2>
    <p>
        We will continue to run further airdrops learning as we go how to best incentivise genuine
        user activity and growth. As such we are likely to propose changes to various aspects such
        as entrance criteria, opportunities for earning CHIT, and the amount of CHAT on offer. But
        for now our best guess is that there will be another CHAT airdrop of 100,000 CHAT at the end
        of every month.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each user has a current CHIT balance and an overall CHIT balance with the amount of CHAT you
        earn in the airdrop being determined by your current CHIT balance which is reset to zero
        after each airdrop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the CHIT for CHAT community, in addition to a channel for the upcoming airdrop, there
        will be a channel for past airdrops which will be publicly readable but closed to new
        members.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>
        The next step is to make a proposal to the DAO for the 100,000 CHAT to be transferred to the
        OpenChat "User Index" canister smart contract which will run the airdrop as described in
        this article.
    </p>
    <p>Now get chit-chatting!</p>
