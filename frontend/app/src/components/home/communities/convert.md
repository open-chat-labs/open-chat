We can take care of converting your public group to a community.

This is an irreversible process and will do the following:

-   freeze the existing public group
-   create a new community with the same name as the group
-   add a default channel to the community with the same name as the group
-   add all members of the group as members of the community
-   copy the full message history from the group into the default channel
-   delete the existing group
-   inform all members of the group that it has been converted to a community

This process might take a few minutes depending on the size of the group so
please be patient.
