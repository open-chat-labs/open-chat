/**
 * This can be used to create a debounced $derived rune. You need to pass in a function the
 * returns all dependencies that you want this to react to (which is annoyingly manual), then
 * pass in the function that creates end result i.e. what you would have passed to $derive.by
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ==============
 * let errors = $derived.by(
 *     debouncedDerived(
 *        () => [$state.snapshot(candidate)],   // this is the (deep) dependency
 *        () => validateBot(candidate),         // this is the work we want to do
 *        500,                                  // this is the delay time in ms
 *        new Map(),                            // this is the initial value of the derived state
 *     ),
 * );
