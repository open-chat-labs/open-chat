See <a href=\"/nsbx4-4iaaa-aaaar-afusa-cai/64\">this motion proposal</a> for details.<br><br>Later this year the OpenChat dev team will make a proposal to implement a user rewards scheme. Diamond users will be able to earn CHAT tokens based on their reputation score within OpenChat. Exactly how reputation is calculated has not been decided but great efforts will be taken to ensure spammers are penalised. We want to encourage genuine chat and not provide an opportunity for bots or unscrupulous users to \"farm\" tokens.",

Like iOS it supports web push notifications but also <em>does</em> support the reading of contacts from the phone (if you grant permisson in each case). Beyond that the support for WebRTC is much better. As such the case for producing a native Android app is less compelling and will come after a native iOS app. The same considerations apply to the building of an Android app as an iOS in terms of aiming for a thin native wrapper around a core web app, and with regards to certification on the Android play store.",

    "ios_app_a": "It is worth saying that the OpenChat web app <em>does</em> already work on iOS and you can \"Add to homescreen\" from the browser menu. This gives you a standard icon to open the app which appears more like a native app without a url bar. Also recently Apple has added support for web push notifications which is crucial for a messaging app if you are offline or not using the app. In general Apple's support for so-called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) lags behind Android because PWAs threaten the dominance of the App Store. It lacks support (compared with Android PWAs) for reading phone contacts and the WebRTC implementation is buggy (needed for peer to peer voice/video calls). Because of these limitations producing a native iOS app is relatively high on our agenda. Although on the face of it OpenChat is \"just a chat app\" it is actually rather complicated with a significant code base. An ideal solution for us, would be to wrap the OpenChat web app in a thin native app which communicates with the native phone APIs in such a way that the large bulk of the code base remains common without compromising the native app experience. We are researching this area but it is not yet clear if this will be possible or how difficult it will be. Another potential road block is the App Store certification process. By having the core application as a web app we could make changes to an OpenChat iOS app without going through an approval process which might not be acceptable. However if these problems <em>can</em> be solved it is possble an iOS app could be ready in a few months. Otherwise, if we need to re-write (and then maintain) a native iOS OpenChat from scratch, then this will take significantly longer...",

You can tell friends and family, tweet about OpenChat, create a video about OpenChat describing what you love about it and share it to TikTok or YouTube.

We look forward to seeing all the creative ideas that you come up with to get the word out!<br><br>In the future we'll open up referral rewards for all users you refer regardless of whether they become Diamond members.

    "security_a": "In short the Internet Computer provides very strong security guarentees. There is however a particular well known area of weakness which Dfinity are tackling.

However, once <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf\">SEV-SNP</a> is available on node machines, users can be extremely confident that, apart from the recipients of their messages, their data will not be accessible to anyone but themselves. At a later date we will implement e2e encryption so that the data is actually stored in encrypted form in canister memory and would therefore not be accessible by rogue node operators regardless of SEV-SNP being in place.

Each user has their own canister which holds all the messages for their direct chats. Each group also has its own canister which holds all the group messages. However, we store any <em>file</em> data associated with messages, such as images and video, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-storage\">OpenStorage</a>. Each user has a data rolling allowance and when a message is sent any file data comes out of the <em>sender's</em> allowance. This also applies to messages sent to groups so there is no group data allowance just an individual one.  <br/><br/> Each OpenChat user will receive 0.1GB of free storage. A user can then optionally upgrade to Diamond to receive 1GB of storage. When a user reaches their storage limit, their oldest files will automatically expire and be reclaimed. This means that a user should never run out of storage. To minimise our costs, free tier user’s files will also be reclaimed after ninety days regardless of their storage usage.
