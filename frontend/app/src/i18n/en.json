Like iOS it supports web push notifications but also <em>does</em> support the reading of contacts from the phone (if you grant permisson in each case). Beyond that the support for WebRTC is much better. As such the case for producing a native Android app is less compelling and will come after a native iOS app. The same considerations apply to the building of an Android app as an iOS in terms of aiming for a thin native wrapper around a core web app, and with regards to certification on the Android play store.",

This gives you a standard icon to open the app which appears more like a native app without a url bar. Also recently Apple has added support for web push notifications which is crucial for a messaging app if you are offline or not using the app. In general Apple's support for so-called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) lags behind Android because PWAs threaten the dominance of the App Store. It lacks support (compared with Android PWAs) for reading phone contacts and the WebRTC implementation is buggy (needed for peer to peer voice/video calls). Because of these limitations producing a native iOS app is relatively high on our agenda. Although on the face of it OpenChat is \"just a chat app\" it is actually rather complicated with a significant code base. An ideal solution for us, would be to wrap the OpenChat web app in a thin native app which communicates with the native phone APIs in such a way that the large bulk of the code base remains common without compromising the native app experience. We are researching this area but it is not yet clear if this will be possible or how difficult it will be. Another potential road block is the App Store certification process. By having the core application as a web app we could make changes to an OpenChat iOS app without going through an approval process which might not be acceptable. However if these problems <em>can</em> be solved it is possble an iOS app could be ready in a few months. Otherwise, if we need to re-write (and then maintain) a native iOS OpenChat from scratch, then this will take significantly longer...",

You will receive half of any Diamond payments they make within the first year of joining OpenChat. You can find your referral link in the \"invite friends/family\" section of your \"profile settings\" from the main menu.<br><br>How might you do this? There are lots of ways. You can tell friends and family, tweet about OpenChat, create a video about OpenChat describing what you love about it and share it to TikTok or YouTube. You could stream on Twitch or write a blog post or create a podcast or host a Twitter space or even hold a real life meet-up. We look forward to seeing all the creative ideas that you come up with to get the word out!<br><br>In the future we'll open up referral rewards for all users you refer regardless of whether they become Diamond members. However because this is easily exploitable we'll first need to introduce some type of \"proof of unique personhood\".",

        "security_a": "In short the Internet Computer provides very strong security guarentees. There is however a particular well known area of weakness which Dfinity are tackling. With some effort a rogue node provider could install a hacked version of the node software allowing them to intercept and read ingress messages and directly read memory. However, once <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf\">SEV-SNP</a> is available on node machines, users can be extremely confident that, apart from the recipients of their messages, their data will not be accessible to anyone but themselves. At a later date we will implement e2e encryption so that the data is actually stored in encrypted form in canister memory and would therefore not be accessible by rogue node operators regardless of SEV-SNP being in place. This will likely involve some limitations, such as not being able to search your message history, so you could choose to opt-in to e2e security for selected chats.",

        "send_tokens_a": "When sending tokens as a chat message, the transfer is performed by the ledger for the given token which incurs a mandatory fee.

        "storage_a": "Text messages take little space and so cost us relatively little. Images typically take much more space and the costs add up. Now some background on the OpenChat system. Each user has their own canister which holds all the messages for their direct chats. Each group also has its own canister which holds all the group messages. However, we store any <em>file</em> data associated with messages, such as images and video, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-storage\">OpenStorage</a>. Each user has a data rolling allowance and when a message is sent any file data comes out of the <em>sender's</em> allowance. This also applies to messages sent to groups so there is no group data allowance just an individual one.  <br/><br/> Each OpenChat user will receive 0.1GB of free storage. A user can then optionally upgrade to Diamond to receive 1GB of storage. When a user reaches their storage limit, their oldest files will automatically expire and be reclaimed. This means that a user should never run out of storage. To minimise our costs, free tier user’s files will also be reclaimed after ninety days regardless of their storage usage. Note that the message itself, including any caption and an image thumbnail, would never be deleted and so the message history would be maintained.",

It often takes a native language speaker to provide a better translation. If you have selected one of our non-english supported languages in your profile, you will notice that there is also a toggle in your profile to activate translation correction mode. With this mode enabled, you will see a small translate icon next to each label within the UI that has been translated. If you click this icon you will then be able to submit a suggested correction. Try to come up with a suggestion that is both accurate and fits well into the UI. You can check how your suggestion looks in place and repeat the procedure as many times as you like. Your suggestion will be reviewed by the team and will be adopted if approved. You will be rewarded in CHAT for each approved correction you provide. We really appreciate you taking the time to make our translations better - we couldn't do it without you.",

This account will initially be empty but you can top up the account by transfering tokens to its address. Once you have some tokens in your OpenChat wallet you will be able to send them directly to the account of any other OpenChat user via a special kind of message. You can also use the ICP (soon CHAT) in your wallet to upgrade to Diamond membership. If you would like to send the tokens to another account you can do so by opening your wallet from the main menu and clicking the \"send\" link. This screen gives you the option to send your tokens to any other address of your choosing.",
