        "ios_app_a": "It is worth saying that the OpenChat web app <em>does</em> already work on iOS and you can \"Add to homescreen\" from the browser menu. This gives you a standard icon to open the app which appears more like a native app without a url bar. The big limitation for iOS web apps is the lack of support for web push notifications. OpenChat sends notifications to indicate receipt of a new message which is important if you don't have the app open. In general Apple doesn't do a very good job of supporting so-called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) because they threaten the dominance of the App Store. It also lacks support (compared with Android PWAs) for reading phone contacts and the WebRTC implementation is buggy (needed for peer to peer voice/video calls). Because of these limitations producing a native iOS app is high on our agenda. Although on the face of it OpenChat is \"just a chat app\" it is actually rather complicated with a significant code base. An ideal solution for us, would be to wrap the OpenChat web app in a thin native app which communicates with the native phone APIs in such a way that the large bulk of the code base remains common without compromising the native app experience. We are researching this area but it is not yet clear if this will be possible or how difficult it will be. Another potential road block is the App Store certification process. By having the core application as a web app we could make changes to an OpenChat iOS app without going through an approval process which might not be acceptable. However if these problems <em>can</em> be solved it is possble an iOS app could be ready within a few months. Otherwise, if we need to re-write (and then maintain) a native iOS OpenChat from scratch, then this will take significantly longer...",
        "android_app_q": "When will there be an Android app?",
        "android_app_a": "As for iOS (see above), the OpenChat web app <em>does</em> already work on Android and you can \"Add to homescreen\" from the browser menu. This gives you a standard icon to open the app which appears more like a native app without a url bar. However, unlike iOS, Progressive Web App (PWA) support is very good on Android. It <em>does</em> support web push notifications and it <em>does</em> support the reading of contacts from the phone (if you grant permisson in each case). Beyond that the support for WebRTC is much better. As such the case for producing a native Android app is less compelling and will come after a native iOS app. The same considerations apply to the building of an Android app as an iOS in terms of aiming for a thin native wrapper around a core web app, and with regards to certification on the Android play store.",
        "find_groups_q": "How do I find groups?",
        "find_groups_a": "There are currently two ways to find public groups. You can find a link to üî• hot groups in the main menu. This shows 20 groups you are not already a member of, ordered primarly by the amount of recent activity but also with a random factor. This changes every 10 minutes. Note that if you \"preview\" a group and then click the \"leave\" button you won't be shown this group in the hot list for 30 days. You can also search for any public groups from the main search bar based on find matches in the group title and summary.  Going forward we will make it easier still to find groups you might be interested in.",
        "style_messages_q": "Can I style messages?",
        "style_messages_a": "You can add line breaks by using shift-enter and you can use a subset of markdown as follows:<br /> \\_<em>italics</em>\\_ or \\*<em>italics</em>\\*<br /> \\*\\*<strong>bold</strong>\\*\\*<br /> \\*\\*\\*<strong><em>both</em></strong>\\*\\*\\*<br /> \\~<s>strikethrough</s>\\~<br /> \\[link text\\](https://oc.app)<br /> \\`<code>let a: int = 10; // code</code>\\`",
        "storage_q": "How does storage work?",
        "storage_a": "Text messages take little space and so cost us relatively little. Images typically take much more space and the costs add up. Now some background on the OpenChat system. Each user has their own canister which holds all the messages for their direct chats. Each group also has its own canister which holds all the group messages. However, we store any <em>file</em> data associated with messages, such as images and video, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/open-ic/open-storage\">OpenStorage</a>. Each user has a data rolling allowance and when a message is sent any file data comes out of the <em>sender's</em> allowance. This also applies to messages sent to groups so there is no group data allowance just an individual one.  <br/><br/> Each OpenChat user will receive 0.1GB of free storage. A user can then optionally upgrade to Diamond to receive 1GB of storage. When a user reaches their storage limit, their oldest files will automatically expire and be reclaimed. This means that a user should never run out of storage. To minimise our costs, free tier user‚Äôs files will also be reclaimed after ninety days regardless of their storage usage. Note that the message itself, including any caption and an image thumbnail, would never be deleted and so the message history would be maintained.",
        "airdrop_q": "Will there be an airdrop?",

See <a href=\"/nsbx4-4iaaa-aaaar-afusa-cai/64\">this motion proposal</a> for details.<br><br>Later this year the OpenChat dev team will make a proposal to implement a user rewards scheme. Diamond users will be able to earn CHAT tokens based on their reputation score within OpenChat. Exactly how reputation is calculated has not been decided but great efforts will be taken to ensure spammers are penalised. We want to encourage genuine chat and not provide an opportunity for bots or unscrupulous users to \"farm\" tokens.",
        "security_q": "Are my messages secure?",
        "security_a": "In short the Internet Computer provides very strong security guarentees. There is however a particular well known area of weakness which Dfinity are tackling. With some effort a rogue node provider could install a hacked version of the node software allowing them to intercept and read ingress messages and directly read memory. However, once <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf\">SEV-SNP</a> is available on node machines, users can be extremely confident that, apart from the recipients of their messages, their data will not be accessible to anyone but themselves. At a later date we will implement e2e encryption so that the data is actually stored in encrypted form in canister memory and would therefore not be accessible by rogue node operators regardless of SEV-SNP being in place. This will likely involve some limitations, such as not being able to search your message history, so you could choose to opt-in to e2e security for selected chats.",

This account will initially be empty but you can top up the account by transfering tokens to its address. Once you have some tokens in your OpenChat wallet you will be able to send them directly to the account of any other OpenChat user via a special kind of message. You can also use the ICP (soon CHAT) in your wallet to upgrade to Diamond membership. If you would like to send the tokens to another account you can do so by opening your wallet from the main menu and clicking the \"send\" link.

See \"Top referrers\" in the main menu.<br><br>In the future we'll open up referral rewards for all users you refer regardless of whether they become Diamond members.
