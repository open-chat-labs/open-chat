/**
 * The idea here is to respond to changes in reactive state in ways that require side-effects
 *
 * For example: the route changes (a state change) and we need to load some data (a side-effect)
 *
 * Currently we handle this in the Home component but this is arbitrary - it really has nothing to
 * do with the component hierarchy.
 *
 * Question: Are these effects going to get out of hand and become impossible to reason about?
