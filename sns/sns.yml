# The voting reward rate falls quadratically from
# `initial_reward_rate_basis_points` to `final_reward_rate_basis_points` over
# the time period defined by `reward_rate_transition_duration_seconds`.
#
# The default value is 1. Values of 0 result in the reward rate always being

#
reward_rate_transition_duration_seconds: 0
#
# The voting reward rate controls how quickly the supply of the SNS token
# increases. For example, a reward rate of 2% will cause the supply to increase
# by at most 2% each year. A higher voting reward rate incentivizes people to
# participate in governance, but also results in higher inflation.
#
# An initial and a final reward rate can be set, to have a higher reward rate at
# the launch of the SNS, and a lower rate farther into the SNS’s lifetime. The
# reward rate falls quadratically from the initial rate to the final rate over
# the course of `reward_rate_transition_duration_seconds`.
#
# Setting both `initial_reward_rate_percentage` and `final_reward_rate_percentage`
# to 0 will result in the system not distributing voting rewards at all.
#
# The default value for initial_reward_rate_percentage is 0. The value used
# by the NNS is 10%.

#
# It is possible to give a higher voting weight to older neurons by setting
# `max_age_bonus_percentage` to a value other than zero. This parameter,
# `max_neuron_age_for_age_bonus`, sets the age at which the maximum bonus will
# be given. All older neurons will be treated as if they are this age. The unit
# is seconds.

# The default value is 126230400 seconds (48 months).

#
# Users with a higher dissolve delay are incentivized to take the long-term
# interests of the SNS into consideration when voting. To reward this long time
# commitment, this parameter can be set to a value larger than zero, which will
# result in neurons having their voting weight increased in proportion to their
# dissolve delay.
#
# If neurons’ dissolve delay is set to `max_dissolve_delay_seconds`, their
# voting weight will be multiplied by `max_dissolve_delay_bonus_multiplier`.
#
# The default value is 2. The value the NNS uses is 2. A value of 1 results in
# no change in voting weight for neurons with higher dissolve delays.
# Values below 1 are prohibited.

initial_voting_period_seconds: 345600
#
# The wait for quiet algorithm extends the voting period of a proposal when
# there is a flip in the majority vote during the proposal's voting period.
#
# Without this, there could be an incentive to vote right at the end of a
# proposal's voting period, in order to reduce the chance that people will see
# the result and vote against.
#
# If this value is set to 86400 seconds (1 day), a change in the majority vote
# during at the end of a proposal's original voting period the voting period
# being extended by an additional day. Another change at the end of the extended
# period will cause the voting period to be extended by half a day, and so on.
#
# The total extension to the voting period will never be more than twice this
# value.

# SNS INITIAL TOKEN DISTRIBUTION
#
# This field sets the initial token distribution. Initially, there is only support for
# the FractionalDeveloperVotingPower strategy. This strategy configures how SNS tokens and neurons
# are distributed in four "buckets": developer tokens that are given to the original developers of
# the dapp, airdrop tokens that can be given to any other principals that should have tokens at
# genesis, treasury tokens that are owned by the SNS governance canister, and sale tokens which
# are sold in an initial decentralization sale but parts of which can also be reserved for future
# sales.
# All developer and airdrop tokens are distributed to the defined principals at genesis in a basket
# of neurons called the developer neurons and the airdrop neurons, respectively.
# If only parts of the sale tokens are sold in the initial decentralization sale, the developer
# neurons are restricted by a voting power multiplier. This voting power multiplier is calculated as
# `swap_distribution.initial_swap_amount_e8s / swap_distribution.total_e8s`.

# As more of the swap funds are swapped in future rounds, the voting power
# multiplier will approach 1.0.
# The initial token distribution must satisfy the following preconditions to be valid:
#    - developer_distribution.developer_neurons.stake_e8s.sum <= u64:MAX
#    - developer_neurons.developer_neurons.stake_e8s.sum <= swap_distribution.total_e8s
#    - airdrop_distribution.airdrop_neurons.stake_e8s.sum <= u64:MAX
#    - swap_distribution.initial_swap_amount_e8s > 0
#    - swap_distribution.initial_swap_amount_e8s <= swap_distribution.total_e8s
#    - swap_distribution.total_e8s >= developer_distribution.developer_neurons.stake_e8s.sum
#
# - developer_distribution has one field:
#    - developer_neurons: A list of NeuronDistributions that specify the neuron's stake,
#      controlling principal, a unique memo, and dissolve delay. These neurons will be
#      available at genesis in PreInitializationSwap mode. The voting power multiplier
#      is applied to these neurons.
#
# - treasury_distribution has one field:
#    - total_e8s: The total amount of tokens in the treasury bucket.
#
# - swap_distribution has two fields:
#    - total_e8s: The total amount of tokens in the sale bucket. initial_swap_amount_e8s will be
#      deducted from this total.
#    - initial_swap_amount_e8s: The initial amount of tokens deposited in the sale canister for
#      the initial token sale.
#
# - airdrop_distribution has one field:
#    - airdrop_neurons: A list of NeuronDistributions that specify the neuron's stake and
#      controlling principal. These neurons will be available at genesis in PreInitializationSwap
#      mode. No voting power multiplier is applied to these neurons.
