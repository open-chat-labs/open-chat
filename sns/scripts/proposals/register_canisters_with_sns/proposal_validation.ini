TITLE="Register ProposalValidation canister as an SNS controlled canister"
URL="https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat/blob/8e4a2fa275ba9ce89cad49820abb711ef4e150f7/backend/canisters/proposal_validation/impl/src/lib.rs"
SUMMARY="This proposal hands control of the new ProposalValidation canister over to the OpenChat SNS.

For each SNS proposal which calls a custom function, there must be a corresponding 'validation' function which validates the proposal's payload and provides a human-readable rendering of it.

Sometimes we want to call into canisters which belong to external services (eg. InfinitySwap). These proposals still require validation functions, so this canister exposes a validation function for each external service function we want to call via SNS proposal.

At first there are 2 functions:

**infinity_swap_receive_tokens_validate**
InfinitySwap's \`receive_tokens\` function notifies their swap canister that we have transferred tokens to it

**infinity_swap_mint_validate**
InfinitySwap's \`mint\` function instructs their swap canister to 'mint' the tokens we have transferred it into liquidity

In the future there are likely to be many more functions added to this canister."
