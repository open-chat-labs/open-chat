TITLE="Register MarketMaker canister as an SNS controlled canister"

SUMMARY="This proposal hands control of the new MarketMaker canister over to the OpenChat SNS.

This canister is currently only integrated with ICDex but in the future it can integrate with many more order book DEXes.

It will poll the CHAT/ICP market on ICDex once every minute to get the latest price and any existing orders, it will then determine if it should create any additional orders, and if so, will make them.

This canister will hold a pool of CHAT and ICP tokens transferred from the OpenChat SNS treasury by proposal which it uses to make market orders.

It will not manipulate the market in any way. It will only make limit orders which add liquidity to the market, it will not make market trades and therefore will not move the price itself. The Bid and Ask orders on either side of the latest price will be balanced so that buyers and sellers both have access to the same amount of liquidity.

The code for the MarketMaker canister can be found [here](https://github.com/open-ic/open-chat/blob/c7a496d445937acf51080748a0cb272f0b5095ad/backend/canisters/market_maker/impl/src/lib.rs). The bulk of the market making logic is contained [here](https://github.com/open-ic/open-chat/blob/c7a496d445937acf51080748a0cb272f0b5095ad/backend/canisters/market_maker/impl/src/jobs/run_market_maker.rs)."
