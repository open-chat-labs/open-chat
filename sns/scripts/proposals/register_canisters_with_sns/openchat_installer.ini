TITLE="Register OpenChatInstaller as an SNS controlled canister"
URL="https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat/blob/master/backend/canisters/openchat_installer/impl/src/lib.rs"
SUMMARY="Some top level OpenChat canisters now exceed 2MB which means they cannot be upgraded directly by proposal, instead we will upload their wasms in chunks to the OpenChatInstaller canister which will then use \`install_chunked_code\` to upgrade them."
