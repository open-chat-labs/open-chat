FUNCTION_NAME="Set community verification"
FUNCTION_DESC="This proposal will mark the given public community as 'verified' (blue tick) if it passes. The proposal summary should be used to provide evidence that the given community legitimately represents the given name. Additionally, if a different name is provided for this community and this name is already used by an existing public community or group which isn't itself 'verified' then this proposal will rename that community/group by adding a random suffix like _436 and the given community will take on the given name. This is to address the scenario where a public community or group has been created for a name which it doesn't legitimately represent."
