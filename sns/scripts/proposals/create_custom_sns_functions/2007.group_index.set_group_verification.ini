FUNCTION_NAME="Set group verification"
FUNCTION_DESC="This proposal will mark the given public group as 'verified' (blue tick) if it passes. The proposal summary should be used to provide evidence that the given group legitimately represents the given name. Additionally, if a different name is provided for this group and this name is already used by an existing public group or community which isn't itself 'verified' then this proposal will rename that group/community by adding a random suffix like _436 and the given group will take on the given name. This is to address the scenario where a public group or community has been created for a name which it doesn't legitimately represent."
