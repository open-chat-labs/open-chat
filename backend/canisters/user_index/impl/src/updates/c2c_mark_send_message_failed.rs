// When sending a direct message, the message is first sent from the client's device to their own
// user canister, their canister then forwards the message on to the intended recipient's canister.
// That c2c call can fail if the recipient's canister is stopped due to it being in the middle of an
// upgrade. If that happens the user's canister will instead call c2c_mark_send_message_failed, the
// user_index will then call back into the user's canister once the recipient's canister has
// finished upgrading allowing the canister to try sending the message again.
